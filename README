OMPlex
======

OMPlex is a Plex-based interface to OMXPlayer on the RaspberryPi.  Using a Plex
device, such as a smartphone or tablet, one can connect to OMPlex and playback
videos on their RaspberryPi.

OMPlex is still quite rough around the edges, but it is useable, with the
following exceptions:

    1. No transcoder support
    2. No channel support (haven't tested)
    3. No support for the web-based remote at plex.tv/web
    4. Only videos are supported (no picture or music support)
    5. No subtitle support
    6. No GUI on the RaspberryPi

All of these things are on the TODO list, including at least a basic OSD.  A
simple OSD that displays the currently playing media info, artwork and progress
bar has been developed using OpenVG and runs very smoothly on the RaspberryPi.
It will be added once more bugs have been ironed out.

Much of this work is based off of the (now defunct) PyPlex project, with the
main difference being that OMPlex uses the (undocumented) "Timelines API".
Support for this API was basically reverse engineered from Plex HT and Plex
for Roku sources as well as some Wireshark snooping.  The other main peice
comes from the PlexGDM project.

Installation
------------

OMPlex is written mainly in Python, so you will need a relatively recent
2.x version--2.6 or 2.7 should work just fine.  The following Python libraries
are also required:

    * Requests  (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/requests/)
    * pexpect   (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pexpect/)

You'll also need OMXPlayer, obviously.

This will be packaged up more cleanly once it matures, but in the meantime,
just run:

    python cmdline.py

You'll be prompted for you MyPlex username and password.  You should now see
"omplex" as a player from your Plex remote.

Alternatives
------------

    * PyPlex (https://github.com/dalehamel/pyplex) - This doesn't work with the
      new Plex app on iOS, at least for me.  It also seems to be dead.
    * RasPlex (http://rasplex.com/) - Some of the devs from PyPlex seem to have
      jumped ship and are now trying to get Plex HT to run on the RaspberryPi.

RasPlex is really the ideal solution--a full HTPC interface for Plex, awesome.
In reality though, I have my doubts that Plex HT will ever run satisfactorily
on the Pi.  OMPlex player is to be lightweight and simple.  Browse your Plex
catalog on your phone and playback videos through the RaspberryPi.
